#Athiti Font

Athiti means The Sun.

Athiti is a Sans Latin & Loopless Thai typeface which its humanist style leaves a touch of writing tool and writing method in letters. Curvatures outside and angled counters create contrast which distribute feelings of strength and softness in the same time. Athiti can be used as a mixture of formal and informal content for example in an educational work, especially under all historical topics such as historical books, websites. Under the same area Athiti can be used in the historical places such as an instruction or flyers for museums etc.

A similarity between some glyphs such as [ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ] [ฎ ฏ] [บ ป] [ข ช] is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

There is a specific approach on how to deal with thick and thin stroke for Thai glyphs. In order to develop Thai fonts, it is encouraged to take this font as an example for such method and other developments.

Informal loopless Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal one, so this allows designers to extend the font to black weight and more in some cases.

#Athiti Font

Arthiti, a sans serif typeface family with a friendly personality based on humanist calligraphy, has an organic look and feel  while preserves the traditional construction of roman typography. It all started with a desire to learn more about the origin of the strokes on human handwriting. Its unparalled outline and inline is designed on purpose to reflect a trace of writing tools as related to the handwriting inspiration. The family consists of 6 weights to be used as headline or body text according to the objective.
